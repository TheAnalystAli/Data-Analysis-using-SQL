Used SQL for data cleaning and manipulating the data given.
Standardized the date formate of the data using CONVERT.
Many null values and duplication were in the data so finished it by usnig different clauses.
Address, city and the state were written in the same column so divided them into separate columns by using PARENAME and SUBSTRING.
Changed the formate of Y and N into YES and NO by using CASE WHEN.
Removed all the duplicate usig ROW_NUMBER and PARTITION BY.
Finally deleting all the unused and unwanted columns.
